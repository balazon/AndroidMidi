# AndroidMidi
Simple Midi synthesizer for Android using sonivox opensles library


This is a simple working project for AndroidStudio 2.2 preview 3

It has a button that you can press:
-on touch down, it will play the middle C (pitch value = 60) sound on a piano (note on)
-on touch up, it will let go of that same note

Credits go to billthefarmer's midi project : https://github.com/billthefarmer/mididriver
This project is essentially a copy of his smarek branch of the midi project but in a simple Android example project
configured for the new AndroidStudio preview version.

This project was tested on a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact device.
